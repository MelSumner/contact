contact
=======

A really simple contact form, set up to ask a few questions and email the responses to specified email addresses. This was originally set up using a shared hosting option on Dreamhost and uses Google Fonts, Bootstrap, and Bootstrap Validator.

It's written in PHP, but could have been done similarly in C# on .net (if you want to use an IIS setup) or even just a combination of Wufoo and MailChimp, if you want it to be even easier.
